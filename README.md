The fire alarm and sprinkler system has been developed to detect fire risks early and provide rapid intervention. Once the temperature is detected by the NTC sensor, an alarm is triggered, and the fire is extinguished with the water pump. The system, controlled by Arduino and L298N, is implemented in a house model designed with AutoCAD.
