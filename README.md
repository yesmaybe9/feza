# 🔥 Fire Alarm System and Water Spraying  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is designed to **detect fire risks early and ensure a quick response**.  
When the **temperature sensor** detects a fire, the **buzzer** provides an audible warning, and the **mini water pump** activates to spray water on the fire.  

🎯 **Objective:** Minimize loss of life and property by ensuring a fast reaction in fire situations.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Fire Detection:** Uses an NTC thermistor sensor to detect temperature changes.  
✅ **Audible Alert:** The buzzer sounds an alarm when a fire is detected.  
✅ **Automatic Response:** The water pump activates to spray water on the fire.  
✅ **Arduino Uno Control:** The system is managed through an Arduino Uno.  
✅ **Modular Design:** Can be applied in homes, workplaces, and public buildings.
